### Installation Steps


#### Prerequisites

You'll need the following installed:
* **Node.js** 
* **npm** 
* **Git**


1.  **Clone the Repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone [https://github.com/](https://github.com/)[YourUsername]/CaringPaws.git
    cd CaringPaws
    ```

2.  **Backend Setup (Server):**
    a. Navigate to the server directory and install dependencies:
       ```bash
       cd server
       npm install
       ```
    b. **Setup Environment Variables:** Create a file named **`.env`** in the **`server`** directory. This file is excluded from GitHub for security. You must insert your personal MongoDB Atlas Connection URI and a secure JWT Secret key.
       ```
       # server/.env structure (Do NOT commit your actual values)
       PORT=5000
       MONGO_URI='mongodb+srv://[username]:[password]@[cluster-name].mongodb.net/CaringPawsDB?retryWrites=true&w=majority'
       JWT_SECRET=[your_secure_jwt_secret]
       ```
    c. Run the Express server:
       ```bash
       npm start
       cd .. # Return to root
       ```

3.  **Frontend Setup (Client):**
    a. Navigate to the client directory and install dependencies:
       ```bash
       cd client
       npm install
       ```
    b. Run the React development server:
       ```bash
       npm start
       ```
    The React application will open in your browser (typically `http://localhost:3000`), using a proxy configuration to communicate with your local Express server (usually on port 5000).
